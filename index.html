        <p> My name is Arjun. I am a computer engineer by qualification. I graduated in computer science in 2008, but my career in advertising took me away from programming to sales and product management roles.  
        </p>
       <p> I came to <strong>Github</strong> to brush up my programming skills and also to learn new and exciting (and more relevant) technologies that will empower me to accomplish my entreprenuership objectives. </p>
        <p>This is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarode">LinkedIn profile</a>, and also the best way to connect with me.</p>
